Course Project A

Assume that the whole universe of stocks is Nifty 100 <https://www.nseindia.com/market-data/live-equity-market?symbol=NIFTY%20100>. Obtain the price data for each of these stocks for the period 01-Jan-2016 to 15-Mar-2021. Also, obtain the market index (NIFTY50) values over the same period.
 

Task 1: Plot the daily stock price of each of these companies. Present the time-series characteristics of these prices. Construct total return and log total return series. Plot the return series and present their time-series characteristics.

Task 2: Check the distribution of these returns. Present test statistics whether the returns are following a normal distribution. If not, then fit other distribution types which fit the data better.

Task 3: Assuming the data to be following a normal distribution, estimate the returns, variances, standard deviation, variance-covariance matrix.

Task 4: Construct a Markowitz portfolio and plot the efficient frontier. Prove that the portfolio frontier will have a parabolic structure.

Task 5: Use a risk-free rate of 5% and plot the Security Market Line (SML). Demonstrate a few underpriced and overpriced securities.

Task 6: Read about at least one other approach to estimate variance-covariance matrix and implement the same.

Task 7: For the actual return distribution that you have observed, identify the suitable return, and risk measure and highlight how those should be considered in the portfolio weight identification.

Tool: Use R or Python

 

Course Project B (Requires trading over a period)

Consider top 15 stocks from above set in terms of them offering highest Sharpe ratio and include them in your virtual portfolio. Implement a portfolio using <https://moneybhai.moneycontrol.com/> platform from these 15 stocks. Assume that short selling is prohibited.  

Task 1: Report the excel/R/Python based demonstration of how the portfolio mechanics will be for this in terms of weights, sharpe ratio of your portfolio.

Task 2: Trade on the platform during 25-03-2021 to 25-04-2021. And report the portfolio value and other statistics.

Task 3: What has led to the difference that you observe in the theoretical results and the platform-based outcome?
